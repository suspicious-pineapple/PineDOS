Building the cross compiler stuff (in cross/) is somewhat important.

C wrappers for assembly functions will be defined in asmutil/cwrappers.asm

terminal color palette is defined in colors.asm

names of various variables are found at the bottom of kernel.asm

todo: MOVe things to C. assembly is insanity



roadmap:
	- interrupts
	- keyboard driver
	- more libc functions
	- bump allocator
	- improve allocator
	- a shell
	- disk driver, primitive file system (-> maybe FAT driver)
	- hex viewer/editor
	- userspace programs somehow?
		- text editor

	- ???
	- multitasking (later: preemptive multitasking)
	- IP/TCP stack
	- Telnet?
	- virtual memory? long mode? paging?
